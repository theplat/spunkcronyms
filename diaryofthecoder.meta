Why? Why not? I've been working with a good friend recently who is teaching me, and a few others, the ropes of the cloud and the pythons
and the IaC world. After a recent friday lesson where we did a very very basic python webapp, I found myself on the back patio with a pint
(as you do)...

My wonderful wife had come across a segment on a popular podcast she likes (stick tap comedy bang bang) and read me a list of silly list
of alternate names for cum. Being a forever child this amused me greatly. 

Turns out ... spunkronyms.com was available ... and since I was supposed to craft my own silly API type webapp as homework ... 2+2=4



v0.1.1 - This is nothing more than a rework of an old python script I was given back when I first tried to make a dockerfile. 

I created the initial list of spunkcronyms from the podcase, and added in a few of my own. 
I edited the script to read in that file to a list
I wrote, probably the ugliest code ever to take the len of that list, generate a random number and print a formatted string
(bonus points to me for finding a function I could import for the random number generation!)


and after fixing many typos and silly syntex errors, suddenly it started! and sure as shit, It randomly gives me a synonym for cum!


HUZZZZAH


Next steps - clean up the code somewhat, create a docker container that spins up, grabs the latest files from github, and serves the site

Long term next steps
    - terraform to launch the docker host
    - same terraform to update DNS record 
    - ansible to install docker and pull the image

LONG term next step
    - combine the whole thing into one bigass bash script where I can type CUMONSOMETHING and have the whole infra spin up, do the things
      and make a live website appear!


HUZZAH!
